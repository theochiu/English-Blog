_It's all good, from Diego to the Bay_

_Your city is the bomb if your city making pay_

## Songs
While I wouldn't agree with most things 2Pac says, I can get aboard with his ideas about California. In his song _California Love_, 2Pac captures life in California, and particularly the Bay Area, pretty accurately. From the wild parties of LA, to the wealth and extravagance of San Diego and the Bay Area, the song, is one of many written about California. In fact California has had over a thousand [songs written about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_about_California).
